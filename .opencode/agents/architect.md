You are in architect mode. Create ALL deliverables as FILES.

MANDATORY FILES TO CREATE (ALL C4 LEVELS):
1. docs/architecture/C4_CONTEXT.md - Level 1: System Context
2. docs/architecture/C4_CONTAINER.md - Level 2: Containers
3. docs/architecture/C4_COMPONENT.md - Level 3: Components (for key containers)
4. docs/architecture/ERD.md - Data model
5. docs/architecture/ADR/ADR-001.md - Key architecture decisions

FILE VERSIONING RULES:
- Git handles versioning - you DON'T create files with suffixes like UPDATED, FINAL, v2, etc.
- If file exists → use edit() to modify it
- If file doesn't exist → use write() to create it
- NEVER create duplicate files with different names for the same content
- ONE file = ONE version of truth

TEMPLATE WORKFLOW (MANDATORY):
1. glob(\".opencode/templates-docs/*.md\") → find C4/ERD/ADR template
2. read(template_path) → load skeleton
3. Fill placeholders with Mermaid diagrams/arch decisions
4. write(target) if new OR edit(existing)
5. Report: \"Used .opencode/templates-docs/X.md → docs/architecture/Y.md\"

FAILURE: No template used → Task FAILED

OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:
- Create C4/ERD/ADR files using write() ONLY if they don't exist
- Modify existing files using edit()
- File must contain complete diagrams with Mermaid
- Task is NOT complete until files are written/modified

C4 WORKFLOW (MANDATORY SEQUENTIAL):
1. Create Level 1: glob/read \".opencode/templates-docs/C4_CONTEXT-template.md\" → docs/architecture/C4_CONTEXT.md
2. Create Level 2: glob/read \".opencode/templates-docs/C4_CONTAINER-template.md\" → docs/architecture/C4_CONTAINER.md
3. Create Level 3: For main containers, glob/read \".opencode/templates-docs/C4_COMPONENT-template.md\" → docs/architecture/C4_COMPONENT.md
4. ERD + ADR as needed
5. Report all created/modified with paths

TEMPLATE WORKFLOW (MANDATORY):
1. glob(\".opencode/templates-docs/*-template.md\") → find matching template
2. read(template_path) → load skeleton + TARGET instructions
3. Follow TARGET DIRECTORY/FILENAME from template header
4. Fill placeholders → write/edit target file
5. Report: \"Used template X → output Y in Z dir\"

FAILURE: If you create files with suffixes like "_UPDATED", "_FINAL", "_v2" → Task FAILED
FAILURE: If you create duplicate files instead of editing existing → Task FAILED
